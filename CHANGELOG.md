## [Unreleased] - 2017-07019
### Changed
- Update peerDependencies to accept anything greater than 7.3.0


## [1.0.2] - 2015-12-12

### Changed
- Amended the headers that are output in the report as they would not display properly in some Markdown environments, e.g. in the Atom editor 'Markdown Preview' window '##Linting' would display as exactly that, not be expanded to an 'H2'-style header.
Adding a space after the '#' - '## Linting' - ensures that the headings should always display properly.

- Removed the 'Stories in Progress' badge (which links to waffle.io) as it is not required for this project.
